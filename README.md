ng-start is a simple front-end starter for AngularJS applications.
Follow the steps below to use:

1. git clone https://github.com/andrebaltieri/ng-start/ "Your project folder"
2. cd "Your project folder"
3. npm install
4. grunt bower cssmin uglify

Or try all at one time
git clone https://github.com/andrebaltieri/ng-start/ "YOUR_APP_HERE" && cd "YOUR_APP_HERE" && npm install && grunt bower cssmin uglify

Now you have node_modules, bower_components and wwwroot folder on your project.
You are free to edit bower.json, packages.json and Gruntfile.js

The wwwroot contais a assets folder, with minified CSS and uglified/minified JavaScripts
